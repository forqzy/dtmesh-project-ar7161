This directory has tools that use the diagnostic interface to fetch data.
Note that most of these can only be used (currently) when the HAL is built
with AH_PRIVATE_DIAG enabled.

For the moment the only supported tools are:

ani		Modify ANI parameters
reg		Read/Write registers

Note that these tools do very little error checking so if they are
out of sync wrt the HAL they can easily do the wrong thing.
