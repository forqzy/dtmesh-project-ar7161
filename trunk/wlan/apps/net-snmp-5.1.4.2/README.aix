Some notes for the AIX port
===========================

It's been reported that the applications segfault on AIX. The reported
fix was to disable shared libraries:

   ./configure --disable-shared

There is also a quoting problem on AIX, so  you will need to fix the quotes
in include/net-snmp/net-snmp-config.h after running configure. For example,
change

  #define CONFIGURE_OPTIONS ""'--disable-shared'""

to

  #define CONFIGURE_OPTIONS "'--disable-shared'"
