.UC 4
.SH NAME
SYSCONFDIR/snmp/snmp.conf, ~/.snmp/snmp.conf - configuration files for the Net-SNMP applications.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmp.conf
is the configuration file which define how the Net-SNMP applications
operate.  Tokens that can be put in them are described in the
.B DIRECTIVES
section below.
.PP
SYSCONFDIR/snmp/snmp.conf is a common file, shared by all users of the system.
.br
~/.snmp/snmp.conf is a personal file, with configuration settings for a
particular user.
.SH PLEASE READ FIRST
Make sure you make these files readable only by the user if you are
storing sensitive information in them like passphrases!
.PP
First, make sure you have read the
.I snmp_config(5)
manual page that describes how the Net-SNMP configuration files
operate, where they are located and how they all work together.
.SH DIRECTIVES
.IP "mibdirs (mib-dirs|+mib-dirs)"
Look for textual MIBs to parse in the list of ':' separated
directories.  If the directive value starts with a '+' it prepends
this list to the front of the default directory list compiled into the
application.  Note that this value can be overridden by the
.B MIBDIRS
environment variable.
.IP "mibs (mib-tokens|+mib-tokens)"
Specifies a ':' separated list of MIB tokens that represent textual
MIB files that should be found and parsed.  If the directive value
starts with a '+' it prepends this list to the front of the default
MIB token list compiled into the application.  The special keyword of
"ALL" forces all MIBs files found to be read. Note that the value
specified here can be overridden by the
.B MIBS
environment variable.
.IP "mibfile file"
Specifies a textual MIB file to read and parse, in addition to the
list read from the MIBs token.  Note that the value specified here can
be overridden by the
.B MIBFILES
environment variable.
.IP "persistentDir directory"
The directory where snmpd and snmptrapd stores their persistent data
files.
.IP "tempFilePattern pattern"
The file pattern used by snmptrapd to create temporary files.  Example:
/tmp/snmpdXXXXXX.  Used by mkstemp() and mktemp() functions.
.IP "clientaddr [<transport-specifier>:]<transport-address>"
Specify source address used by command-line tools, see
.I snmpcmd(1)
, and by snmpd when sending notifications.
.IP "defaultPort port"
The default port number that all SNMP applications and daemons should use.
.IP "defVersion (1|2c|3)"
The default SNMP version to use.
.IP "defCommunity string"
The default SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c community string to use.
.IP "defSecurityModel string"
The SNMP security model to use. Defaults to "usm" which is the only widely 
used security model for SNMPv3.
.IP "defSecurityName string"
The default SNMPv3 USM security name you want to use for SNMPv3 requests.
.IP "defContext string"
The default SNMPv3 context name you want to use.
.IP "defPassphrase string"
.IP "defAuthPassphrase string"
.IP "defPrivPassphrase string"
The default SNMPv3 USM passphrase(s) to use.  
.B defPassphrase
will be used for both authentication and privacy pass phrases if it is 
specified.
.IP "defAuthType MD5|SHA"
The SNMPv3 USM authentication type to use.
.IP "defPrivType DES|AES"
The SNMPv3 USM privacy type to use.
.IP "defSecurityLevel noAuthNoPriv|authNoPriv|authPriv"
The SNMPv3 default security level to use.
.IP "showMibErrors (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether or not to display textual MIB parsing errors when commands are
run.
.IP "strictCommentTerm (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether or not MIBs that are parsed should be strict about comment
termination.  "--" terminates a comment if this is true.  Many
MIBs have broken comments in them, hence this option.
.IP "mibAllowUnderline (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Allow underline characters in MIBs (illegal).
.IP "mibWarningLevel integerValue"
The minimum warning level of the warnings printed by the MIB parser.
.IP "logTimestamp (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether the commands should log timestamps with their error/message
logging or not.  Note that output will not look as pretty with
timestamps if the source code that is doing the logging does
incremental logging of messages that are not line buffered before
being passed to the logging routines.  This option is only used when file logging is active. 
.IP "printNumericEnums (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -Oe .
.IP "printNumericOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -On .
.IP "dontBreakdownOids (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -Ob .
.IP "escapeQuotes (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -OE .
.IP "quickPrinting (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -Oq .
.IP "printValueOnly (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -Ov .
.IP "dontPrintUnits (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -OU .
.IP "numericTimeticks (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -Ot .
.IP "printHexText (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -OT .
.IP "suffixPrinting (0|1|2)"
If the value is 1, its equivalent to
.B -Os
and if the value is 2 it's equivalent to
.BR -OS .
.IP "oidOutputFormat (1|2|3|4|5|6)"
Maps -O options as follow: -Os=1, -OS=2, -Of=3, -On=4, -Ou=5.
The value 6 has no matching -O option. It suppresses output.
.IP "extendedIndex (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Equivalent to
.BR -OX .
.IP "noRangeCheck (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Disables the validation of values that is done by
.B snmpset
before issuing the request to the agent.
Equivalent to
.BR -Ir .
.IP "noDisplayHint (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Disables the use of DISPLAY-HINT information when parsing indices and
values to set. Equivalent to
.BR -Ih .
.IP "dumpPacket (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Whether the commands should dump packets by default.
.IP "doDebugging (1|0)"
Turns on debugging for all applications run if set to 1.
.IP "debugTokens TOKEN[,TOKEN...]"
The debugging tokens that should be printed.  See the
.I snmpcmd(1)
manual page for debugging usage details.
.IP "reverseEncodeBER (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Encode packets from back to front. Defaults to true. You'll rarely want to
change that.
.IP "16bitIDs (1|yes|true|0|no|false)"
Restrict requestIDs, etc to 16-bit values.
.IP "noTokenWarnings"
Do not warn about unknown config file tokens.
